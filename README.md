<h1>PHI Language</h1>
<h3>Soon operating systems will be as easy to code as desktop apps</h3>
<h4>Goals:</h4>
    
    1. Direct access to ASM
    2. Optional memory safety 
    3. Syntax Efficiency 
    4. Compile to ASM and then to Binary
    5. Compatibility with C

<h4>Timeline:</h4>
<li>Write Assembly equivilents for PHI functionality</li>
<li>Write a PHI to Assembly converter in C#</li>
<li>Write a Assembly Intel x86(and AT&T eventually) to Arm converter in C#</li>
<li>Expand PHI to be a full language</li>
<li>Rewrite the converters in PHI so the language is self dependent</li>
<li>Basic set of drivers as built-in functions</li>
